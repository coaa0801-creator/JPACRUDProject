## Overview
Use SpringMVC to interact with MYSQL database on a hosted site.

## Step by Step (Short Version)
1. Landing Page index.html
2. Choose desired option from button list
3. Fill in search or new input information
4. View search results
5. Option to edit/delete returned information.
6. Confirmation of user action

## Walkthrough (Long Version)
This program works to simulate a small bike shop and allows an employee to work through the inventory list, pull up specs, edit, add or delete entries.

The database is queried using JPQL and other shorthand context to allow for quicker processing.

This is the very beginnings of the prototype and would be significantly improved on the UI side upon initial client approval of the design in theory.


## Struggles
I'm still working on passing the information through the buttons. Knowing when to ask for parameters and how to go about it.

Time was an issue on this one. While I think I got all of the goals done. I was really crunched for time with all of the wedding things going on. This was absolutely not what I would have had in mind for a final project to present but for only getting about 3 hours of working time after initial setup, I'm pretty proud of how quickly I was able to pull this/what I have together.

## Lessons Learned
Check the pathing. I wasted a good chunk of time on finding little errors like forgetting to copy the .do or some little transposition.

Setup is everything. Once you have a good setup. Things can really fly together.
